# A bit of Knowleadge
## What is this?
Is a CFG ( Configuration ) for CSGO to automatically set your settings to play. ( Execept Graphics Settings ) Mostly for MM Competitive but for other types of competitions is allowed to. - Report back if there is something illegal. ( I think Jumpthrow bind is illegal in some competitons, but I really don't know. )

## Do I need it?
Not exactly, but you can try it and decide for yourself it you want it or NEED it. :P

2. Place the CFGs into your CSGO CFG folder ( ..\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg ).
3. Edit it by changing the Sensitivity, Personal Color, Hud Color... etc in other to adapt it to your liking ( on Personal_Settings.cfg ).
4. Launch CSGO and press F10 to open the console. Type in "exec autoexec" or "Autoexec" ( CFG needs to be re-executed in order to properly work ).
